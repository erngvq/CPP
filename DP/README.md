## Dynamic Programming (Memoization & Tabulation)

* Write a function `fib(n)` that takes in a number as an argument. The function should return the n-th number of the Fibonacci sequence. Recall that the first and second number of the sequence is 1, and to generate the next number we sum the previous two.

* Imagine you are a traveler on a 2D grid. You begin in the top-left corner and your goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner. However, you many only move down or right. Write a function `gridTraveler(m, n)` that computes how many ways you can travel to the goal on a grid with dimensions `m * n`.
